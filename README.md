## Refelction

Write a brief reflection (100-200 words) discussing:

- Challenges you encountered during the project.
    During this project, one of the main challenges encountered was achieving accurate alignment between the elements inside the main container. Properly positioning logos, icons, progress bars, and text required careful consideration of layout techniques to ensure consistency across different screen sizes. Fine-tuning the alignment was especially tricky given the complexity of nested flexboxes and the need for visual balance within the given background and container constraints.

- Your approach to solving these challenges.
    To address these challenges, the approach focused on reading documentation thoroughly and experimenting with different coding methods. By adjusting Bootstrap’s flex and grid utilities, and testing variations in alignment classes, widths, margins, and padding, the design was iteratively improved. This trial-and-error methodology helped in understanding how Bootstrap’s responsive layout system works in practice, offering insight into how elements behave under varying screen conditions and how to maintain coherence and attractiveness.

- Improvements you would make if given more time.
    If given more time, deeper implementation of Bootstrap’s features would be a priority. This includes mastering responsive grid layouts, spacing utilities, and component classes, to streamline the coding process and create more flexible, maintainable designs. A stronger familiarity with Bootstrap would greatly ease the integration of responsive and complex styling, reducing reliance on hardcoded styles and making the project more scalable and adaptable.
